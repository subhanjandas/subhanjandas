<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm Subhanjan Das</h1>


<p align="justify">As a data visualization and dashboarding aficionado, I am passionate about turning raw data into intuitive, interactive dashboards that empower organizations to make data-driven decisions. Utilizing my expertise in tools such as Tableau, Google Analytics, and Excel, I have a proven history of crafting visually compelling and informative dashboards that effectively communicate key insights. My skill-set includes data analysis, data modeling, and the creation of interactive charts and graphs. In addition to my technical expertise, I pride myself on being a creative problem solver with an innate ability to distill complex data into easily digestible visuals that resonate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I am a lifelong learner, constantly seeking new opportunities to enhance my skills and to make a meaningful impact by helping organizations unlock the full potential of their data through effective visualization and dashboarding</p>

  <summary><b><h2>‚ú®&nbsp;&nbsp;About&nbsp;Me</h2></b></summary>
  <br/>

<p align="justify">I am a postgrad student of Business Analytics with 11 years of coding experience.</p>

<p align="justify">I started in 2009 with HTML and CSS, making simple static web pages and expanding my knowledge over time. Around 2010/2011, I started to learn how to use JavaScript to create dynamic web apps. During this time I also learned a version of BASIC so I could program games for my 3DS, using a DSi app called Petit Computer. In 2015 I found NodeJS, and started using it to create some basic bots for various chat platforms.</p>

<p align="justify">My goal with coding is to help others. I enjoy being able to create something that other people can use to make their lives easier. I take criticism well, and use suggestions to improve the product. The wants and/or needs of the userbase are always my priority, because without a supportive userbase, the product has no real purpose.</p>

<p align="justify">Over the last few years, my knowledge and experience with NodeJS have expanded, as has my main project, which currently has nearly one million users. I am fluent in using JavaScript and JSON within the Node environment, as well as all the features of ES11. I also have a solid understanding of HTML and CSS, and am able to work with web apps or other browser-based environments.</p>

Most of my leisure time is to contribute to open-source projects on GitHub. Acknowledging my extensive contribution to DuckDuckGo's open source projects, I was promoted as a maintainer and community leader with write access to all DuckDuckGo's repositories. I had contributed to Mozilla, Angular, Svelte, Node.JS, and several other open-source projects and organizations.

I also maintain and contribute to a lot of community open-source projects and libraries. Some of the communities includes [Tinkerhub Foundation](https://tinkerhub.org/), [Kites Foundation](https://kitesfoundation.org/), [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/), [Patternfly](https://www.patternfly.org/) etc. I strongly believe that the true value of open-source is not just the code, it's the community around it.

You can learn more about me and my open source journey at my website: [https://www.gautamkrishnar.com/](https://www.gautamkrishnar.com/)

Most of the open-source projects I create are the solutions to the problems I face in my life, there are even more that are yet unsolved. I am on a journey to find solutions for them, one at a time.
