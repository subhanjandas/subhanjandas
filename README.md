  <br/>

<p align="justify">I am a postgrad student of Business Analytics with over a year of professional experience in eCommerce and Internet Services Industry.</p>

<p align="justify">I started in 2020 with Python, making simple data exploration projects and expanding my knowledge over time. Around mid-to-end 2021, I started to learn Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts with Python libraries like SciKitLearn, Keras, TensorFlow to create predictive models. During this time I also started with my Analytics post graduate program and learned Big Data tools like Apache hadoop with Hive and Pig for web scraping and Business Intelligence tools like Tableau, Power BI and IBM Cognos. I am currently working at Tucows as a Customer Intelligence Researcher, building a strong foundation in data analytics and reporting</p>

<p align="justify">Over the last year, my knowledge and experience with Business Intelligence tools have expanded, as has my interest. I am proficient in using Tableau and Power BI with Python and SQL environment, as well as Google Cloud Platform. I also have a solid understanding of Mathematics and Statistics, and am able to work with large and complex datasets. My goal with data analytics, visualization and Reportin is to help others. I enjoy being able to create something that stakeholders can use to make their desions easier and data driven </p>

  - [Bank and Credit Card Complaints Analysis using Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/BankandCreditCardComplaintsDashboard/Dashboard1?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) - <br> Built a dashboard using Tableau that analyzes credit card complaints data. The dashboard allows for a comprehensive analysis of the data through the use of custom calculations and parameters. This enables users to identify patterns and trends in the data, and make data-driven decisions. The visualizations in the dashboard are interactive and visually appealing, making it easy to understand and interpret the data. The purpose of the project is to improve customer satisfaction and reduce complaints by gaining a better understanding of the complaints data. <br/>
  - [Employee Attrition - What makes employees quit?](https://github.com/subhanjandas/Digital-Music-Store---Data-Analysis-using-SQL) - <br> This is an in-depth project that utilizes Tableau, Power BI, Python, Pig Latin, and Hadoop to gain a deeper understanding of IBM's workforce. The project meticulously investigates the Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) that influence employee attrition by leveraging the power of big data analysis. The project's results, in the form of recommendations, aim to aid IBM in enhancing employee retention and minimizing turnover rates. The project exemplifies the capability of advanced big data tools and visualization techniques to unveil actionable insights from large datasets. <br/>
